# Tiltify Donations to Minecraft World Border
Update the world border of a locally running Minecraft server based on donations from a Tiltify campaign.


~~Utilises a structure list generated by my [Minecraft Structure Finder](https://github.com/Lordimass/Minecraft-Structure-Finder) 
to tell players which new structures have been revealed by the latest donation.~~<br>
^ This was never implemented due to time constraints.
